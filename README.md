### Final Project â€“ Quiz App

This project was developed as part of my final project during my further education program. It is a simple quiz application built with Angular. It's designed to demonstrate some features like routing, reactive forms, validation and component-based architecture. Users can select a quiz, answer multiple-choice questions, and view their results upon completion.
